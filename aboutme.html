<p> Hi My name is Savannah Milton. I am a 16 year old who attends the Highschool of Fashion Industries. I am very passionate about computer science, fashion, and writing. Originally I'm from Baltimore Maryland and I moved to New York to come to a fashion school in the hopes of pursuing my dream. When it comes to things I want I am very motivated about going out and getting it. Along the way in my journey I fell in love with computer sciene. I had always thought about learning about coding and Code Nation made tat a reality. They exposed me to a new career path in life and I'm ready to give that a try.</p>
